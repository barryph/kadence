# Authentication

Here we separate authentication into it's own module. This was the recommended approach by gipity and others online. Conceptually it makes sense, separating the authentications application and infrastructural concerns separate from the users, but may not be the most practical.
Stemmler in his ddd-form repo instead includes authentication in his users module (DDD module).

## Social authentication (Google & Apple)

The `infrastructure/providers/` directory contains the provider verification
logic (`GoogleProvider`, `AppleProvider`), which derive identity exclusively
from cryptographically verified provider credentials. `ExternalIdentityService`
resolves/creates the application user. See `docs/oauth-sign-in.md` for full
configuration, flow, account-linking behaviour, and security assumptions.
